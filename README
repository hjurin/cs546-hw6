This repository contains all the source code for parallel IO homework.
It also contains all tests and tests results.
All files are described at the bottom of this README.

# BUILD AND RUN

A Makefile has been implemented with following commands:
    (default)   build the solution into the executable "benchmark"
    print       prints the content of the file for part 1 into the good format
    mrproper    deletes the executable, output files and test results

Just launch ./benchmark to see the argument description

# LAUNCH TESTS

The test script simply launches the benchmark over data of different size and with a
various number of processes and stores the results in elapsed_times.csv

To launch it just tap
    ./test.sh

The test script should have the right execution rights, if not, just tap
    chmod +x *.sh

The shibang may be wrong under your distribution, you should then replace the path
in the first line by the result of
    which bash

# FILES DESCRIPTION

* homework.c                  Is the source code for the homework, it has a header homework.h
* test_plotting.ipynb         Contains the jupyter-notebook for plotting elapsed times
* test.sh                     Is the test script.
* genuine_elapsed_times.csv   The used csv file. It will not be erased if you run tests.
