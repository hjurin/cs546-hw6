This repository contains all the source code for parallelizing the resolution AX+B.
It also contains all tests and tests results.
All files are described at the bottom of this README.

# BUILD AND RUN

A Makefile has been implemented with following commands:
    (default) build all solutions
    mrproper delete all executables, parasite files and test results

# LAUNCH TESTS

Tests should have the right execution rights, if not, just tap
    chmod +x *.sh
These test simply launch the solution over different sized matrix (size 10 to size 1000 with step 10)
and store their result elapsed times in elapsed_times.csv
/!\ the test test_pthread.sh requires an argument (1, 2 or 3 depending on the method to test)

# OUPUTS

Each execution of solutions will write outputs in output_files directory.
If no filename is given in paramter, the default filename is HH_MM_SS_program.txt
If programs are launched through tests, the output are hidden.

# FILES DESCRIPTION

In all files, print_time() has been added.
It outputs the elapsed time into the csv file.

* gauss_normal  It is the original source code.
    I added function to output in files and some global variables at the beginning.
    Nothing significant has been edited here.
* gauss_mpi1    MPI solution
* gauss_pt1     First pthread solution
* gauss_pt2     Second pthread solution
* gauss_pt3     Third pthread solution

* test_plotting.ipynb       Contains the jupyter-notebook for plotting elapsed times
* resources                 Contains the plots of elapsed times
* genuine_elapsed_times.csv The used csv file. It will not be erased if you run tests.
